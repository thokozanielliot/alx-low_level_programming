# Bit Manipulation

How to manipulate bits and& use bitwise operators

## Task 0. 0

Using `unsigned int nbinary_to_uint(const char *b)`
Where "b" is a string of 0 & 1 chars

Convert a binary number to an unsigned int

## Task 1. 1

Using `void print_binary(unsigned long int n)` function

Print the binary representation of a number

## Task 2. 10

Using ` int get_bit(usigned long int n, unsigned int index)`
Where "index" is the index starting from 0

Fnction returns the value of a bit at a given index


## Task 3. 11

Using `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)` function
Where "index" is the index starting from 0

Set the value of a bit to 1 at a given index

## Task 4.100

Using `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)` function
Where "index" is the index starting from 0

Set the value of a bit to 0 at given index

## Task 5. 101

Using ` unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)` function

A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
